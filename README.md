# plex-pin

The point of this package is so you can easily create an app that requires authentication without the user needing to input the credentials of the plex account and instead use the Plex.tv/pin api to get an authorize users via PIN.

This repository is intended to be for the npm version. 

I will create a repository for a Meteor package.
